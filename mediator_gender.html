            <p>What comes to your mind when we talk about gender? Some people feel proud, curious, passionate and some feel anxious, scared and distant. Recently the discourse over gender has also become polarized. Not having the right Hungarian vocabulary makes our questions feel uncomfortable and we don’t have the intention to hurt anybody - so we often stay silent. However, if we lean into our vulnerability, we might be able to gain valuable experiences.
            The aim of my associative cards linked with the alkotás13's workshop with art theraphy tools is to create an intimate, non-judgemental space, where we can explore our thoughts and feelings concerning gender identity, what we need in order to experience it more freely. During the playful process participants could share their thoughts and feelings when they felt like it.
